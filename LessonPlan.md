Resource: www.codepen.com

Resource Description: Codepen is the perfect place to get started in web development.  Here you can write code and immediately see the results.  Once you make an account, you can easily share your project URL so others can see your work!  The first section of challenges will use Codepen, and answers can be submitted as links to your pens.

Challenge 0:

Make an account on codepen.com.  Add some text in the 'HTML' section, save it, and post it here! (once I get that section ready.  In the meantime, shoot me a message on Discord with your result!  My Discord username is morningpants#2407)
